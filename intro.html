    <p>I am a Graphic Design student at Algonquin College with a BA in linguistics. My background and studies in American Sign Language lend themselves to my focus on accessibility and the intersection of language and design. While I am open to any opportunity to create, my passion is in the field of creative concepting.</p>

    <p>Graphic design has always been an interest of mine but I was unsure whether or not I would seek out a college education for this field. However, I drawn to the Algonquin College graphic design program due to its reputation of industry-knowledgeable instructors, co-op opportunities, and proximity to my place of living. As my time in the program progresses, the original assets that drew me in are still relevant, but more factors have emerged as sources of inspiration. Seeing the work I completed and the skills I have acquired in such a short time- as well as positive reinforcement from my teachers- has shown me that I do not need to doubt my decision to pursue a more creative career path. I feel encouraged that even though I started my post-secondary education in an unrelated field, my age and diverse experience has been revealed to be an asset rather than a reason to be embarrassed. Overall, I hope to continue utilizing my strengths of maturity and out-of-the box thinking to further succeed in the graphic design industry.</p>
